# how I made a markdown parser

So... Markdown; The sister of markup languages like HTML. Pretty easy to type in, hence why places like Discord, Reddit, and forums use it.

And thus why I wanted to use it on this blog, so I got to work.

At the surface it seems like turning Markdown into Markup would be simple. turn the \#s into \<h1>s, turn the \*s into \<i>s.

***I wish.***
